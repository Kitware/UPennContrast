# FAQ

# General Overview:

1. What is NimbusImage?  
   1. NimbusImage is a cloud-based image analysis platform designed for researchers in the life sciences. It offers a unique combination of flexibility, scalability, and user-friendliness, allowing users to build personalized analysis tools using the most advanced image-processing algorithms. Key advantages are:  
      1. Flexibility: NimbusImage allows for a large number of different types of analyses through its flexible design.  
      2. User-friendly: NimbusImage has an easy to navigate interface that allows users to discover and use important features.  
      3. Cloud-based: Because NimbusImage runs in the cloud, users don’t have to manage complicated installations and huge datasets spread over several local drives.  
      4. Power: NimbusImage integrates many modern machine learning algorithms to speed up your analysis.  
2. Who is NimbusImage for?  
   1. NimbusImage strikes a balance between ease of use and power. First year graduate students (or seasoned graduate students looking to wrap up that one last figure for their paper) can get up to speed quickly and perform their analyses. Power users who want to run large-scale analyses can use many of the advanced features, including machine learning, data import and export, and programmatic control, to power their advanced analyses and also enable new visualizations that would formerly be impossible.  
1. What types of data analysis can I perform with NimbusImage?  
   1. NimbusImage was designed to efficiently address the diverse needs of scientists performing image analysis in the life sciences. One of the primary challenges with image data is to take the picture and turn it in to a number, so to speak. NimbusImage helps facilitate this process. Most image analysis pipelines take an image, identify objects within it, and then quantifies various aspects of those objects, like “Count the number of spots in these cells” or “Measure the distance from the speckle to the nucleolus” or “Measure the distance between the stem cell and the basement membrane”. NimbusImage gives you many options for both object identification and quantification, and then allows you to export your results into standard tables for downstream analysis with Excel, R, or whatever other analysis software you like.  
2. How does NimbusImage differ from other image analysis tools?  
   1. NimbusImage has a few key differences from existing image analysis platforms:  
      1. It is entirely cloud based. That means you don’t have to install software, manage packages, or lug around hard drives filled with massive datasets.  
      2. It injects human interaction into the pipeline. Most software has end to end pipelines where you find objects, quantify them, and output the graph. This makes it difficult to fix those places where your analysis is faulty, like, a bunch of falsely detected “cells” in an out-of-focus area, for instance. NimbusImage allows you to just select and delete those objects and move forward with the rest of your analysis.  
      3. NimbusImage is highly flexible. It uses a tagging system that allows it to work with virtually any type of workflow. That means that you can do the specialized analysis you want without having to force the software to do something it wasn’t designed to do.  
3. Is NimbusImage open source?  
   1. NimbusImage is open source, and all the code is freely available on GitHub. Anyone can install it on their own local computer, server, or cloud platform of their choosing. All the analysis modules are also open source. Transparency is fundamental to the reporting of science, and as such, we believe that analysis tools must be open for others to scrutinize and improve.

4. Is NimbusImage suitable for beginners and those with little experience with image analysis?  
   1. Absolutely\! NimbusImage was built to support users at all levels of proficiency, from beginners to experts. The intuitive user interface makes it easy for novice users to navigate the platform and start analyzing their images quickly, while also providing advanced features and customization options for more experienced users. For experienced users, if you can think of an option, just look around or ask—it probably already exists.  
      To help users get the most out of NimbusImage, we have created an extensive library of video tutorials that guide you through various aspects of image analysis within the platform. These videos cover a wide range of topics and are designed to cater to users with different backgrounds and skill levels.  
      In addition to our video tutorials, NimbusImage offers a built-in chatbot that is fully versed in the platform's features and capabilities. The chatbot can provide instant assistance and guidance as you work on your image analysis tasks, helping you overcome any challenges you may encounter along the way.  
      If you need further assistance, we are here to help. You can reach out to us by email. We are committed to ensuring that every user, regardless of their experience level, has a smooth and productive experience with NimbusImage.  
5. Can NimbusImage handle large datasets?   
   1. Absolutely\! NimbusImage is designed to manage large and complex datasets with ease. When considering the data that NimbusImage can handle, we categorize it into two main types: data storage and data processing.  
      In terms of data storage, NimbusImage can accommodate datasets in the order of terabytes, whether you need passive storage (e.g., for archiving data) or active storage (e.g., for data that you will soon analyze using the tools you are building within the platform). Our flexible storage options ensure that you can store and access your data efficiently, regardless of the size of your datasets.  
      When it comes to data processing, NimbusImage has been rigorously tested with images up to 10GB per image, which the platform can handle well. This means you can process most moderate-size multi-dimensional datasets without experiencing performance issues or limitations. Internally, we have tested much larger files and they usually work fine, but occasionally can give issues.  
      On the analysis side, we have found that NimbusImage generally works well until you get to millions of objects, at which point some aspects get bogged down. We are currently working to resolve some of those bottlenecks.  
      If you encounter any challenges with processing your data due to size constraints, our team is here to help. Simply reach out to us via email, and we will work with you to find a solution tailored to your specific needs. We are committed to ensuring that NimbusImage can handle your large datasets effectively, enabling you to focus on your research and analysis without worrying about data management issues.  
6. What are the system requirements for using NimbusImage?  
   1. NimbusImage was designed to work as a cloud-computing solution operated through a web browser. This means that as long as you have a reasonably well-powered computer with internet access, you should be able to use NimbusImage without any issues. NimbusImage handles the heavy lifting of processing and storing your data in the cloud, allowing you to access and analyze your images from anywhere with an internet connection. We recommend using a modern web browser such as Google Chrome, Apple Safari, or Mozilla Firefox for the best user experience. Currently, the only browser specific feature is the segment anything tool, which requires Chrome because Chrome has enabled WebGPU.  
      However, we understand that some users may prefer to install NimbusImage locally on their computers. If you are interested in installing NimbusImage on your local machine, you can follow the instructions on the Github repositories. We are also here to help you with that process.   
7. Is NimbusImage cloud-based or a desktop application?  
   1. NimbusImage is fundamentally a cloud-based application. However, it is also possible to run it locally. See the GitHub repositories for installation instructions. It uses standard web front and back end technologies, like Node, Docker, and Python. Note that some machine learning features will not run in this mode unless you have the right hardware (Linux, GPUs).  
8. How secure is my data when using NimbusImage?  
   1. NimbusImage has high grade security and various authentication and security features. However, any patient data should not be uploaded to NimbusImage and violates our terms and conditions.  
9. Are there any tutorials or guides available for new users?  
   1. Yes. Go to [https://arjun-raj-lab.gitbook.io/nimbusimage/vignettes](https://arjun-raj-lab.gitbook.io/nimbusimage/vignettes) where you will find a library of videos that showcase NImbusImage and guide you through different features and concepts.   
10. What are the key features I should be aware of as a new user?  
    1. As a new user of NimbusImage, there are several key features that you should explore to make the most of the platform:  
       1. Personalized analysis tools: NimbusImage allows you to build custom analysis tools tailored to your specific research needs. This means you can create workflows that perfectly match your requirements, ensuring efficient and accurate image analysis.  
       2. Intuitive user interface: Our user interface is designed with simplicity and ease of use in mind. Even if you're new to image analysis, you'll find navigating and using NimbusImage to be a straightforward and enjoyable experience.  
       3. Scalable data processing: NimbusImage leverages the power of cloud computing to process your data efficiently. Whether you're working with a few images or large datasets, our platform can handle the workload, saving you time and resources.  
       4. Flexible data storage: With NimbusImage, you have the option to store your data either in the cloud or locally on your machine. Our platform supports both active storage for data you'll be using frequently and passive storage for archiving purposes.  
       5. Collaboration and sharing: NimbusImage makes it easy to collaborate with colleagues and share your work. You can share your analysis tools, datasets, and results with others, fostering a collaborative research environment.  
       6. Extensive learning resources: To help you get started and make the most of NimbusImage, we provide a library video tutorials which we continue to expand. If you are in need of any specific tutorials that are not on our site, please send us an email. We would be happy to build one.

# What file formats are supported by NimbusImage?

NimbusImage was built to handle a wide range of file formats. Below are just a few of the common ones. If your file format is not listed, feel free to try uploading the data. If you run into any issues, please contact us and we'll be happy to help you out.

## File formats

NimbusImage can read most file formats "out of the box", so mostly you will not have to worry about it. Here, we describe a few considerations for some common formats here. Also, **please do let us know if you are having trouble importing your data.** We have tried to make it as easy and compatible as possible, but there are a quasi-infinite number of formats, so we are sure there are many cases we have not yet encountered.

1. Nikon (.nd2)  
   1. Nikon .nd2 files work essentially out of the box. No need to convert to TIFF or split between multiple files. You can just import them, and the variable assignment should work, and you generally will not need to enable "Transcode to optimized TIFF". If you have a large tiled image, it would be best to stitch the image in Nikon Elements first, if possible. If, however, that is not an option because the file is too large, you can enable "Composite stage positions" and "Transcode to optimized TIFF" and that should be able to do the stitching for you (although that has not been as extensively tested on our end).  
2. Zeiss (.czi)  
   1. Zeiss .czi files work out of the box as well. The only difference is that we have found that performance is better when these files are transcoded inot a TIFF, so by default "Transcode to optimized TIFF" is enabled.  
3. Leica (.lif)  
   1. Leica .lif files are somewhat more complex, because they are more like containers that can contain multiple image sets. For instance, a .lif file could contain a time lapse, a set of Z-stacks, and a few individual multi-channel images. NimbusImage does not currently import multiple datasets at once. Hence, **for .lif files, we select the largest image set and import that one.** We recommend breaking up your .lif file accordingly so that the outcome is predictable. If enough users ask for the feature, we may enable the ability to choose amongst the image sets or allow for multiple imports.  
4. TIFF and OME-TIFF  
   1. Ah yes, TIFF… So TIFF can be imported, and if the variables are set within the TIFF, they will be read. NimbusImage will read most kinds of TIFF files. TIFFs are highly varied, and some may not be read properly. Also, many TIFF files are suboptimally encoded. Hence, by default, "Transcode into optimized TIFF" is enabled to make the images easier to load efficiently, at the cost of some computation time. If you upload multiple TIFF files to be combined (like multiple channels or something like that), we would strongly recommend transcoding them. Only disable this option if you know for sure that the TIFF is optimized.  
   2. Most TIFFs work fine, but there is an issue with OME-TIFFs that are spread across multiple files. (OME-TIFFs in a single file will work just fine.) An OME-TIFF can sometimes have a master file that points to multiple files in a series. This sort of file is not yet supported out of the box, in that you cannot upload all the files and import them directly. However, you can convert this into a single tiff file pretty easily and then import it. Do the following:

      pip install large\_image \# installs the large\_image package  
      large\_image\_converter first\_file\_in\_series.ome.tiff outputfile.tiff

      This will generate outputfile.tiff that then can be directly imported into NimbusImage. **In this case, you do NOT need to transcode into an optimized TIFF**, because large\_image\_converter has already done that for you.  
5. TIFFs from IncuCyte  
   1. The IncuCyte outputs files in a VERY annoying way. They can be directly read into NimbusImage, and it will do its best to handle the naming conventions, but it can be irritating because if you have multi-channel images, it exports them all with the *exact same file names*. Ugh. Anyway, we wrote a little script you can use to clean up the IncuCyte TIFFs and rename them:  
   2. [https://github.com/arjunrajlaboratory/process\_incucyte\_tiff\_data](https://github.com/arjunrajlaboratory/process_incucyte_tiff_data)  
   3. Follow the directory structure very carefully. Also, if you just have a single channel, you still have to have a "phase" subdirectory in which all your files will live.

You can also upload multiple files at once to be combined into a single dataset. For instance, maybe you have multiple stage positions, encoded like phaseimage\_s001.tif, phaseimage\_s002.tif, and so on. Or Z or T or XY or whatever. You can upload these at once and NimbusImage will try to assign these to variables for you automatically, giving you the option to change the variable assignment if you do “Advanced upload”. The general naming convention is to have “blahblah\_t001\_xy002\_z003” for time \= 1, stage position \= 2, z-slice \= 3\. If you run into trouble, let us know.

Currently not supported are RGB images (like H\&E stains). That is planned for a future update.

## Uploading data

Uploading data to NimbusImage is straightforward. There are two main options: Quick upload and Advanced upload. Advanced upload allows for more control over how your image files are parsed into datasets and organized into collections. Quick upload just selects the default for all decisions and allows you to get to see your data as quickly as possible. If you have many files that you are trying to combine, then Advanced Upload may be useful.

If you run into a problem trying to upload your data, contact us at support@cytopixel.com.

1. Quick Upload  
   1. Find your data on your local computer  
   2. Drag and drop the data onto the gray window on the upper left portion of your personal NimbusImage home page.   
   3. Note that the data will automatically be uploaded onto your “private” folder.  
2. Advanced upload  
   1. **Data upload:** First, upload files, name the dataset, and choose the location for the dataset files to be stored.  
   2. **Variable assignment:** The next step in advanced upload is variable assignment: when you have a Z-stack and stage positions and timepoints, each of those is a variable that NimbusImage will let you navigate. Some files, such as .nd2 files or TIFF files with sufficient specification, contain a lot of metadata and the variable assignment is already done. However, it is quite common for data to be stored across multiple files, with the variable encoded in the filename. For instance:  
      1. GFP\_s001\_t001.tif  
      2. GFP\_s001\_t002.tif  
      3. ...  
      4. RFP\_s003\_t010.tif  
   3. In the above, there could be two channel variables (GFP, RFP), 3 stage positions, and 10 timepoints. **NimbusImage will automatically attempt to read these filename variables and assign them.** In the above, it will assign the variable with "s" to XY position and "t" to time and GFP/RFP to channel. Moreover, sometimes the .tif file itself will have multiple images in it. In that case, that series of images can also be assigned to a variable. **NimbusImage will let you change the variable assignment**, giving you complete flexibility over how all these variables are parsed.  
   4. **Compositing:** Sometimes, you want stage position to be a variable you can flip through, like different wells in an image. By default, those will be parsed as different XY positions that can be scrolled through as a variable. However, sometimes you might have images that tile a large field of view, or perhaps you want to visualize all the wells next to each other. In that case, check "Composite", which will put all the data into a single large image using the metadata about the location of the different stage positions.  
   5. **Transcoding into optimized TIFF:** In order to facilitate the ability to navigate large images with high performance, it is important to have a well-optimized file format. We have found that many microscopy formats are unfortunately very inefficient. Hence, we give the option to transcode all the data into a single, well-optimized TIFF file. This transcoding takes some compute time, but results in much better performance in most scenarios, hence it is enabled by default. Some formats, like .nd2, are well optimized from the outset, and so transcoding is not enabled by default for those files.  
   6. **Assigning to a collection:** In the next screen, you can decide how you want to organize your dataset into a collection. The default is to create a new collection. However, you can also choose to add it to an existing collection or make a new collection derived from an existing collection. The latter option makes a copy of an existing collection and puts your file in this copied collection. That is useful if you want to, say, copy over existing viewer settings, but you want to organize this dataset separately.

## Data organization

NimbusImage organizes images into datasets, and datasets can be further organized into collections.

1. What is a “dataset” within NimbusImage?  
   1. A *dataset* is the set of images that you want to visualize and analyze at once. Examples could include:  
      1. A simple image.  
      2. A very large image.  
      3. A Nikon .nd2 file containing a Z-stack for 3 fluorescence channels.  
      4. A Nikon .nd2 file containing 15 positions of Z-stacks for 3 fluorescence channels.  
      5. Large images in 4 channels from a 12 well plate stored across multiple TIFF files.  
      6. Time lapse image data across a set of files.  
   2. A dataset can be from a single file (such as a multidimensional .nd2 file) or could be spread across multiple files. The dataset will also store all objects and snapshots that you make as you analyze your data.  
   3. Datasets are stored on the server as a folder that contains (often multiple) files.  
2. What is a “collection” within NimbusImage?  
   1. A *collection* is a set of datasets that you want to group together for visualization and analysis. For instance, if you collected data from, say, a number of experimental conditions over multiple days, then you may want to group those datasets for each experimental condition into a collection.  
      1. The advantage of organizing datasets into a collection is that the user interface is common across all datasets in the collection. Let's say you set up just the right set of contrast settings, colors, and tools for one dataset and now you want to use those same settings for another dataset. In a collection, those settings will apply across *all* datasets, simplifying that process.  
      2. In order to form a collection, the datasets must be *compatible* in the sense that the datasets have a similar structure. For instance, if one dataset is a time lapse with 2 fluorescence channels and the other is a Z-stack with 3 channels, then they will not be compatible. However, they don't have to have the exact same size. For instance, say you took 15 timepoints for your time lapse recording in condition 1, but 20 timepoints for condition 2\. Those are still compatible as a collection.  
      3. Every dataset belongs to a collection. If you never use collections, that is totally fine, but just be aware that somewhere in there, there is a collection that contains your dataset.  
      4. A dataset can belong to multiple collections. Each collection can provide a different view of the same dataset, because it could have different visualization settings and annotation tools. *However, note that objects are associated with the dataset itself and not the collection.*

      

# Viewing your data

NimbusImage has a full-fledged image viewer highly optimized for in-browser image viewing and navigation. It is easy to navigate but also very flexible, allowing for multiple different views depending on your needs.

## Viewing data

1. Once your data is loaded into NimbusImage, you will interact with it through the viewer. The viewer allows for easy navigation and flexible visualization.  
2. Key features include:  
   1. Easy to use navigation and contrast settings  
   2. "Unrolling" of variables to show montages  
   3. Overview "minimap" in the top left.   
      1. Drag around the square to navigate; shift-click-drag to directly go to a location.  
   4. Dynamic scale bar. Click the scale bar to adjust pixel sizes and other settings.  
   5. Zoom in and out of large images. Scroll wheel zooms, just like Google Maps.  
   6. Flexible layer settings. See below for more information about layers.  
3. Layers:  
   1. Understanding layers can help unlock more flexibility in how you visualize your data. Generally, layers are most commonly thought of as mapping to channels, but in NimbusImage, they are capable of more. For instance, you can make multiple layers that draw from the same channel, but show different times in different colors, which can be very helpful for time lapse analysis. To do this, go to the dropdown for the layer. Then open the “advanced layer options” dropdown. There, you can set which image gets pulled for the specific layer. For instance, you could set Time-Slice to Offset \= 1, which will show the next time point, or \-1, which would show the previous. You can make as many layers as you want. You could make a new layer with the same channel, but with Time-Slice \-\> Offset set to 1 to show the next time point on top of the current time point.  
4. Layer Grouping  
   1. Another useful feature is layer grouping, which allows you to put together multiple layers into a single grouped layer. For instance, if you have a couple fluorescence channels that you always want to show together, you can group them.  
      1. To use this feature, just drag the layers to a "drop zone" to combine. The Dropzone will appear and say “Drag layer here to create group”. You can add a bunch of layers together and they will act as a single grouped-layer.  
      2. You can add multiple layers to the group. Drag layers out of the group to undo the grouping.

## Common viewing questions

3. How do I zoom in and out of an image?  
   1. You can use the scroll bar to zoom the image in and out.   
4. How do I adjust the contrast of my image?  
   1. On the bottom left corner of the screen you will find a palette (see below). Click on it.  
   2. ![][image1]  
   3. Once you do so, a small sub-window will open up for each channel.  
   4. ![][image2]  
   5. Drag the lines at each end of the histograms to adjust the contrast.   
5. How do I turn a channel on and off?  
   1. On the left-hand side of the screen you will find a window that lists all of the channels (see below)  
   2. ![][image3]  
   3. On the right-hand side of that panel, there is a set of toggle buttons with the label “Channel on/off”. Clicking on any one of those buttons will turn on and off the corresponding channels  
6. How do I navigate on the XY, Z, of Time axes?  
   1. On the top left hand corner of the screen there is a window pane (see below) with three rows, one labeled, XY, one labeled Z, and a last one labeled Time.   
   2. ![][image4]  
   3. You can drag the blue dot from left to right to move along each of those axes.   
   4. The number to the right of the blue dot represent the plane/section you are currently viewing, out of the total number of images/planes/sections (which is also listed in that area)  
   5. If you hover your mouse next to the number that indicates the image you are currently viewing, two arrows will appear. You can click on those arrows to manually scroll through the images/planes as well.  
7. What is “unroll” within NimbusImage?   
   1. This allows you to view your images as a montages (e.g., images put together as a tiled array). If you unroll the XY, it will show all your stage positions at once. If you unroll layers, you can see all the different channels at the same time.

# Using tools to find objects in your images:

NimbusImage uses tools to help define objects, which are the starting points of most analyses. Objects are the things in your image that you want to quantify: cells, nuclei, tissue regions.

## Tools in NimbusImage

1. What are “tools” within NimbusImage?  
   1. Tools are the instruments you build to carry out individual tasks, like segmenting a cell, or detecting spots, connecting objects, removing connections, and so forth. Most tools allow you to “tag” objects, which helps you organize your analysis.  
   2. Tools come in a few categories:  
      1. Manual tools allow you to draw blobs, lines, and points directly.  
      2. Automatic tools allow you to use algorithms to automatically find objects and make connections within your dataset. They can use the same tags, making it seamless to integrate your manual fixes with the automated results.  
      3. Connection tools allow you to connect objects and delete connections between objects.  
2. What are “tags” within NimbusImage  
   1. Tags are how we categorize and label the objects within an image that you are interested in. For example, after building a tool to detect nuclei, a tag could be “nucleus”. You can then use this tag to specify that you want to perform computations only on such objects. You can also interact with your images by selecting a specific object within a tag category. For example, you can sort the objects you called nuclei by their measured area. You can then navigate to unusually large nuclei to verify that these are indeed nuclei and not artifacts.   
   2. Tags are critical for organizing your analysis. Objects should all have tags, which allow you to distinguish between, say, blobs that represent mouse vs. human cells.  
3. What are objects, connections and properties within NimbusImage?  
   1. Analysis in NimbusImage is a little bit different than in other tools. The key concepts are ***Objects***, ***Connections***, and ***Properties***. Throughout, the key organizational system is ***tagging***, allowing flexible organization and more intuitive analysis patterns.  
      1. **Objects** are essentially annotations of items of interest within your dataset. Examples are:  
         1. Point objects representing spots of a particular RNA in the cytoplasm.  
         2. "Blob" objects representing the outline of a cell.  
         3. Line objects representing the basement membrane.  
      2. **Connections** between objects allow you to build relationships between objects. For instance, each RNA could be connected to a cell, meaning that that RNA is within that cell. Or a nucleolus object could be connected to a nucleus, or to a nearby paraspeckle. Connections allow you to document and analyze specific relationships, and interact with those relationships visually to get the analysis you want.  
      3. **Properties** are measurements you want to make on objects and connections for the final analysis of your data. For instance, average fluorescence intensity within the nucleus. Or distance from the speckle to the nuclear periphery. Or the length of a filament. Or the number of spots in the cytoplasm.

Here’s a description of the tools that are available currently in NimbusImage, although more are being added all the time.

1. Manual Object tools  
   1. Point  
   2. Blob  
   3. Line  
2. Selection tools  
   1. Pointer Lasso  
3. Automated Object Finding tools  
   1. Some general options for some (but not all) automated tools:  
      1. Batch XY, Batch Z, Batch Time. These allow you to process multiple images across your dataset. Each accepts a range like a printer, like “1-10” or “3-5, 7-9”. We strongly recommend trying it out on a small scale first to ensure that your parameters are set correctly before performing what could be a lengthy operation.  
      2. Smoothing. This is a parameter that smoothes out the boundary of a polygon. With smoothing set to 0, it will trace the boundary of every pixel, which can make for a lot of unnecessary processing. Smoothing values of 0.7-1 tend to strike an appropriate balance between detail and efficiency.  
      3. Padding. This will expand or contact the boundary of the polygon by the given number of pixels. If positive, it will expand. If negative, it will contract. This can be useful if you want to expand a bit outside of the nucleus, or perhaps shrink inside the boundary to be more conservative and prevent overlaps.  
      4. Tile size and overlap. Many modern machine learning tools do not work efficiently on very large images. We have implemented a tiling method called DeepTile that breaks the image down into smaller tiles with an overlap, then reconstructs the annotations on the original image. Make sure that the objects you choose are bigger than the overlap region. For instance, if you have an overlap of 0.1 and a tile size of 1024, then that would work for objects that are smaller than around 100 pixels. In practice, we would recommend the tile overlap by twice as big as the largest object you expect to detect.  
   2. Claude Natural Language Analyzer  
      1. Uses Claude AI to help you interact with NimbusImage and perform some number of custom analyses. Still experimental. It can allow you to do things like “Color all cells green if they contain at least 20 GFP spots” or “Connect all nuclei to the nearest cell”. Requires an Anthropic API key. The output is still experimental at this time. It outputs a JSON in your dataset that then can be read back into your dataset to give you your new annotations. In a coming update, this will be automated.  
   3. Cellpose  
      1. Cellpose is a deep learning-based algorithm for cell segmentation that is integrated into NimbusImage. It was developed by Carsen Stringer at the Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI). This powerful tool allows you to accurately identify and segment cells in your microscopy images with ease.   
      2. cellpose has a couple different models. There is cyto, cyto2, cyto3, and nucleus. Mostly, you will want to use cyto3 and nucleus. If you use cyto3, then set the cytoplasm channel to whatever you think might work, like an actin stain or anything that lights up the cytoplasm. Then set the nucleus channel to whatever channel you have stained the nucleus in. If you use nucleus, then set both channels to your nucleus channel.  
      3. The other main parameter you might want to change is diameter. We have found the results can be fairly sensitive to this choice.  
   4. Connect Sequential  
      1. Connects objects sequentially across time or z-slices. This is very useful for time lapse analysis, where you want to connect objects across time slices.  
   5. Connect to Nearest   
      1. Connects objects to each other based on distance. This is very handy for connecting, for example, RNA spots to the nearest cell for downstream counting or distance analysis.  
   6. Laplacian of Gaussian  
      1. The Laplacian of Gaussian (LoG) is an image processing filter available in NimbusImage that helps detect edges and blobs (regions of uniform intensity) in your images. It combines two main techniques: Gaussian smoothing and the Laplacian operator.  
         1.   
         2. Here's how it works:  
         3. Gaussian smoothing: First, the LoG filter applies a Gaussian blur to your image, which helps to reduce noise and small details. This step makes the subsequent edge detection more accurate and reliable.  
         4. Laplacian operator: Next, the filter applies the Laplacian operator to the smoothed image. The Laplacian operator highlights regions where the image intensity changes rapidly, which typically corresponds to edges or boundaries between different objects.  
         5. By combining these two steps, the LoG filter provides a powerful tool for detecting edges and blobs in your images. It can help you:  
         6. Identify object boundaries and contours  
         7. Detect cells, particles, or other structures of interest  
         8. Preprocess images for further analysis or segmentation  
   7. Piscis (Predict)  
      1. Piscis (Predict) is a machine learning method for spot detection integrated into NimbusImage based on the Piscis package developed by William Niu. It is designed to find spots while eliminating false positives due to background, and is suitable for analyzing single molecule RNA FISH data or anything with spot-like signal. The key parameter is the “Model” you choose. That is what actually determines spots. The two most commonly used models are “20230905” and “ps\_20240419\_112256”. The former is a bit more stringent and the latter a bit more lenient. Other parameters are “scale”, which sets the size of the spots (we find a value of 1 is good for most purposes) and “Threshold”, for which a value of 1 is also good. “Skip frames without tag” is used for skipping frames that don’t have, e.g., “cells” in them, so you don’t waste compute time on useless areas. The last parameter is “mode”. If set to “current Z”, it finds spots just in the current Z slice. If set to Z-stack, then runs the whole algorithm in 3D and identifies spots across Z. That ensures you don’t double count a spot that shows up in multiples frames or undercount multiple spots that are in different Z planes but in the same x, y location. Note that doing current Z and then batching across Z will tend to double count spots that show up in multiple Z planes.  
      2. Once you have counted spots using Piscis (predict), you can count spots within other blob objects (like cells) or connect spots to cells and then count the number of connections.  
   8. Piscis (Train)  
      1. Sometimes the spots you want to detect are not perfectly picked up by Piscis. In this case, you can retrain Piscis to make a new model that is specific for your data. This works by defining regions in which you want to retrain, the manually annotating new spots that Piscis missed and removing extra spots that Piscis added in inappropriately. More documentation on this is coming soon.  
         1. Parameters  
            1. Annotation Tag: Tag for annotations of the spots that you want to train with.  
            2. Epochs: Number of training iterations. Default value should work fine.  
            3. Initial Model Name: Starting model that you want to fine tune. Default value should be fine.  
            4. Learning Rate: Controls how quickly the model adapts to the new data. Default value should be fine.  
            5. New Model Name: Name for the newly trained model.  
            6. Random Seed: Ensures reproducibility of training results.  
            7. Region Tag: Tag for blob regions where training will occur.  
            8. Weight Decay: Prevents overfitting by penalizing large weights. Default value should be fine.  
   9. StarDist  
      1. StarDist is an advanced deep learning-based algorithm for precise cell and nucleus detection in microscopy images. StarDist can be thought of as complementary to cellpose. There are some datasets for which it works better than cellpose and others where it does not.  
      2. One key parameter is the model. There are two options. 2D\_versatile\_fluo is for fluorescence microscopy, and 2D\_versaltile\_he is for H\&E stains. For most applications common in NimbusImage, you could want to use 2D\_versatile\_fluo. Other parameters are probability threshold and NMS threshold. We recommend you look at the stardist documentation to determine how to modify these parameters.

4. Segment Anything Model  
   1. ViT-B. This uses the Segment Anything Model from Facebook to do real-time segmentation with a simple click. You set up the tool just like any other tool. When you select the tool, though, you will start to see a bunch of things happen, like creating a decoder and encoder and so on. That’s a bit of processing that happens behind the scenes to allow for segmentation. Once that is done, you can move your mouse over the image, and you will see what it would select if you were to shift-click. (Note that regular click still helps you move the image around). Shift click and it will make the object for you\! You can also shift-click and drag to make a box around the object you want, which sometimes works better for more complex scenarios.  
      1. Smoothing is an option to set how much it smooths out the final polygon.  
      2. Turbo mode is the default, where you just click and it makes the annotation. If you don’t use turbo mode, you can build more complex prompts for Segment Anything, which include multiple positive and negative points. However, we have found that usually a box prompt is preferable for complex segmentation tasks anyway.  
5. Annotation Connections. Often you will want to connect different annotations together.   
   1. Lasso connect: circle objects that you want to connect.  
   2. Click connect: click two objects one after the other to connect them.  
   3. Lasso disconnect: circle objects that you want to disconnect.  
   4. Click disconnect: click objects that you want to disconnect.

## How do I create a tool?

1. On the left hand side of the screen you will find the “Toolset” box (see below)  
2. ![][image5]  
3. Click on the “+” sign.  
4. A new window will open up. Click on “Select tool type” (see below)  
5. ![][image6]  
6. A new pop-up will open, which will list all of the tools available within NimbusImage (see below)  
7. ![][image7]  
8. Select the tool you want and a new window will open where you will configure the tool:  
   1. Under annotation configuration:   
      1. Select the layer that will “contain” the object.  
      2. Select/create a tag  
         1. If the tag exists, simply pick it from the list  
         2. If this is a new tag, simply type the new tag name  
         3. Tags are a great way to organize your data and analysis. You can use the default values, like “YFP blob”, but we recommend trying to make it more meaningful, like “Nucleus”.  
   2. Name you tool by typing a name under “Tool Name”.  
   3. Optional  
      1. Record a hotkey  
         1. This allows you to toggle between tools by using your keyboard.  
            1. Click on record hotkey  
            2. Type the key (or even multiple keys in a row)  
            3. Note: your can erase the hotkey by hitting “clear hotkey”  
      2. Advanced options:  
         1. Annotation configuration. Here, you can decide which Z slice or time slice you want to assign the object to. By default, it will be “current”, which means that it just puts the object on the current Z layer. This can be changed, however, to be assigned to a particular Z or time slice. Also, by default, the color of the annotation is inherited from the layer color, but if you say “Override layer color with custom color”, you can change this.  
9. Once you have entered this information, click on “Add tool to toolset”.  
10. Your new tool is ready to use\!

## How to edit an existing tool

1. On the toolset window, hover the mouse over the right hand-side of the row that lists the tool you want to edit. A white “pencil” should appear. Click on it.  
2. ![][image8]  
3. A new window will appear, where you can edit the tool, allowing you to change the options.  
4. Note that you can also use this window to delete a tool.  
5. Here is what the window looks like, which is basically the same as the initial tool creation window.  
6. ![][image9]

## How to use a tool I just created

1. On the left hand side of the screen you will find the Toolset window. Your tools should be listed there.  
2. Click on the toolset you would like to use. For manual tools, you can just get started. Most automated tools will open up a parameters window. That will allow you to batch the automated tool across XY, Z, and time. You can change any other parameters here as well, then hit “Compute” to run it. Depending on the job complexity, it may take some time to finish the run; it will show you the progress as it runs.   
3. The default parameters were chosen to work in many cases, so hopefully you do not need to make a lot of adjustments.  
4. If you need to adjust the parameters and do not know what each of them mean, just ask the chatbot. 

# Computing properties

Properties are the properties associated with objects. For example, if you have a bunch of objects corresponding to cells, the area of those objects would be a property. The overall process is to first click the “Measure objects” tab in the top bar to reveal the measurements panel. Here, you will create and run property workers, and then you can see the results in the object list.

In the Measure objects panel, you start by picking a tag of what you want to measure, for instance, “cells”. That will automatically populate the shape based on what shape the objects with that tag are. Then you will see an option to “Measure this property” and a dropdown list with various algorithms like “Blob metrics”. Once you select one of these options, it will allow you to set property-specific parameters, like the channel you want to quantify fluorescence in, the size of the annular region to use, and so on. Below that is the option to change the property name (it will pick a default for you). Then click “Submit” and your property worker will be made. Below that, you will be able to click the “play” button to run the worker itself. Once it runs, the properties are computed and you can find them in the “object list” as we will describe now.

Once computed, the properties are in the object list. You can find them by clicking the Object list tab in the top bar, then opening the “Properties” drop down. That will reveal the computed properties. Note that some properties are “compound” nested properties, like Blob metrics. If you click that, it will show the computed properties, like “Area” and “Perimeter”. If you select those, it will show the property value in the object list below. You will notice there is a tab in the Properties dropdown to also use a property value as a filter (“Use as filter”). That will create a histogram in the filters section where you can list only properties that match the filter values. This is useful if, for instance, you wanted to only show nuclei with an area between 500 and 1000 pixels.

      2. Radius: The radius for the annular expansion around the polygon.  
      3. **Percentile:** The percentile of the intensity to report.  
   2. Output:  
      1. **NumberPercentileIntensity:** The intensity value of the given percentile.  
6. Blob point count: The Blob point count worker computes the number of points within each polygon annotation. It picks points to count by tag. It also has the option to count across all Z slices. If set to No, it only counts the number of points within the same Z slice as the polygon. If set to Yes, it counts the number of points within the polygon across all Z slices, regardless of which Z slice the point or polygon are in.  
   1. Input:

8. Parent and child: This worker computes and stores the parent-child relationships for annotations. It allows you to link up parent and child annotations. It is very useful for time-lapse analysis, because then your downloaded CSV will have all the information about the object over time.  
   1. Input:  
      1. No additional inputs beyond the standard worker parameters (such as the tag and exclusivity settings for annotations to process).  
   2. Output:  
      1. **annotationId**: A unique integer identifier for the current annotation.  
      2. **parentId**: The integer identifier of the parent annotation, or \-1 if there is no parent.  
      3. **childId**: The integer identifier of the child annotation, or \-1 if there is no child.  
9. Point metrics: This worker extracts and stores the x and y coordinates of point annotations. It can be useful if you want to plot the spot coordinates or do some other spatial analysis.  
   1. Input:

      1. **x**: The x-coordinate of the point annotation.  
      2. **y**: The y-coordinate of the point annotation.  
10. Point Intensity: This worker computes various intensity metrics within a circular region around each point annotation. It’s helpful for quantifying how bright various points are. Keep in mind that quantifying point intensity is tricky. We recommend, as a start, to measure the pixel intensity with a radius of 1 and keep the maximum. Then, from that, you can subtract the background. You can compute the background with another worker (we recommend calling it “Background”) by setting the radius to 3-5 pixels and then use the 25th percentile or the median intensity.   
    1. Input:  
       1. **Channel**: The image channel to use for intensity measurements.  
       2. **Radius**: The radius of the circular region around each point, within which intensities are measured (range: 0.5 to 10, default: 1).  
    2. Output:  
       1. **MeanIntensity**: The average intensity within the circular region.  
       2. **MaxIntensity**: The maximum intensity value within the circular region.

11. Distance to nearest blob: This worker computes the distance from each point annotation to its nearest blob (polygon) annotation, with options for distance calculation method and connection creation. It is useful for things like computing the distance from a cytoplasmic spot to the nucleus.  
    1. Input:  
       1. **Blob tags**: Tags to filter the blob annotations (required).  
       2. **Distance type**: Choose between 'Centroid' (distance to blob's center) or 'Edge' (distance to blob's boundary) (default: 'Centroid').  
       3. **Create connection**: Option to create a connection between each point and its nearest blob (default: False).  
    2. Output:  
       1. **Distance**: The distance from the point to the nearest blob, calculated according to the chosen distance type.  
       2. (Optional) Connections between points and their nearest blobs, if 'Create connection' is selected. This can be helpful if you want to do some further downstream analysis.  
12. Point to Nearest Connected Point: This worker computes the distance from each source point annotation to its nearest connected point annotation that matches specified criteria. It is useful if you want to check distances between clouds of points or between different kinds of points.  
    1. Input:  
       1. **Tags of points to measure distance to**: Tags to filter the target point annotations (required).  
       2. **Target tag match**: Choose between 'Any' (partial tag match) or 'Exact' (exact tag match) for target points (default: 'Exact').  
    2. Output:  
       1. **Distance**: The distance from the source point to the nearest connected point that matches the specified criteria.  
13. Point to Nearest Point: This worker computes the distance from each source point annotation to its nearest target point annotation that matches specified criteria. This allows for measuring point to point distances.  
    1. Input:  
       1. **Tags of points to measure distance to**: Tags to filter the target point annotations (required).  
       2. **Target tag match**: Choose between 'Any' (partial tag match) or 'Exact' (exact tag match) for target points (default: 'Exact').  
       3. **Measure across Z**: Option to consider points across different Z-slices (default: False).  
       4. **Measure across T**: Option to consider points across different time points (default: False).  
    2. Output:  
       1. **Distance**: The distance from the source point to the nearest target point that matches the specified criteria.

# Miscellaneous tips

1. How to turn annotations on and off (i.e., visible vs. invisible):  
   1. To turn all annotations off (and back on), press “a”.  
   2. To show information about each annotation on, press “t”.  
   3. To view these options and also the option to turn connections on and off, open Settings \-\> Object display and selection controls.  
   4. For a more fine-grained way to turn on and off annotations with particular tags, there is a “tag cloud”/”tag picker”. It’s in two places: below the layers in the navigation panel on the left, and at the top of the Object list panel. There, you can turn on and off the visibility of specific tags by clicking them. If you have a lot of tags, you can type into the filter box to find just the ones you want. You can also select all or none to turn them all on or off.  
2. When I turn a layer on or off, the annotations from that layer stay. Is there a way to make the annotations show only if the layer is on?  
   1. Go to Object List, and then, near the top, toggle the “Show annotations from hidden layers” slider to off.  
3. When I turn off a layer, I want to hide all annotations on that layer. How do I do that?  
   1. Turn off Object list \-\> Show annotations from hidden layers  
4. Quickly look at commands and hotkeys?  
   1. Press “tab” to bring up a heads-up display.  
5. How do I undo a recent annotation  
   1. Press “command” \+ “Z” to undo your last action  
6. How do I quickly switch between tools?  
   1. Create a hotkey for each tool when creating the tools  
      1. If the tool is already created, you can edit the tool to add the hotkey  
   2. Simply press the hotkeys you created to toggle between tools  
7. How do I perform batch processing on multiple images? For automated annotation workers, you may want to apply the batch processing across multiple timepoints or stage positions or z-slices.   
   1. For automated annotation tools, after you create the tool, then you can click on the worker to bring up the automated annotation tool panel.  
      1. Note that batch analysis is available in the context of automated detection tools.  
   2. The Worker Menu will open up  
   3. Configure Batch Settings:  
      1. Batch Time: set a range, like “1-5” or “1-3, 7-9”  
      2. Batch XY: set a range, like “1-5” or “1-3, 7-9”  
      3. Batch Z: set a range, like “1-5” or “1-3, 7-9”  
   4. Make sure other settings are to your liking, then click “Compute”.  
8. How can I delete erroneous annotations?  
   1. If its a single object:  
      1. Hold down the shift key and click on the object, then press command \+ delete  
      2. You could also create a “pointer tool” to select an object. You can find this tool under “Selection tools”. Then either press command-delete or click “Delete selected” in Object list \-\> Annotation list.  
   2. If it is a group of objects:  
      1. Hold down the shift key and drag your pointer around the group of objects. Then press command \+ delete.  
      2. You could also create a lasso tool to select a group of object. You can find this tool under “Selection tools”.

# Example workflows

Here we provide some example workflows for common tasks.

## I want to count the cells in an image using the DAPI stain of the nucleus and measure their area

1. Load in your data.  
2. Make a cellpose automated worker. Click the plus icon in the Toolset panel. Select cellpose. Change the layer to DAPI. Set the tag to “nucleus” to facilitate downstream analysis.  
3. Click “Create tool”  
4. Click on the tool to bring up the panel. Set the model to nucleus. Set both the nucleus and cytoplasm channels to DAPI. Set the diameter to 20 (or whatever your rough nuclear diameter is).  
5. Click Compute.  
6. You may want to edit the results of the segmentation.  
   1. Say that there were areas where it detected false nuclei. Shift-drag around the problematic nuclei. Then press command-delete to remove them.  
   2. If you want to add additional nuclei, make a new Manual blob tool and make sure the tag is the same (“nucleus”). Circle additional nuclei.  
   3. Another way is to use the Segment Anything Model. Make a new tool and select ViT-B in the Segment Anything Model section. Be sure to choose the same layer and tag. Then create the tool. When you click the tool, it will take a few moments for it to set up the tool. Then, as you move your mouse around, it will highlight objects. Shift-click to make the selection into an object. This allows you to manually identify nuclei quickly without having to laboriously trace individual nuclei.  
7. Now let’s measure the area of the cells.   
   1. Open the Measure Objects tab (top menu bar).  
   2. Under “Create Measurements for Objects Matching”, click in the tag region. Select “nucleus”.  
   3. This will automatically fill in blob for the shape.  
   4. Now click on algorithm to select an algorithm. Click “Blob metrics”. It will bring up some options. Set “Tags of points to count” to “RNA”.  
   5. Click “Submit”. That will make your worker.  
   6. Click the play button next to your new worker.  
   7. Go to the “Object list” tab in the top menu bar.  
   8. Click on the Properties dropdown and click the blob metrics property. That will bring up a submenu where you can click the checkbox for Area.  
   9. The area should show up in the list next to your nucleus objects.  
8. When you are done, you can count cells by going into Object list \-\> Actions \-\> Export CSV. Then you can analyze the result in Excel.

## Counting RNA spots per cell

Let’s say that you have done RNA FISH and you want to quantify the number of RNA in every cell by counting spots.

1. Load in your data.  
2. Circle cells. Let’s first do this manually.  
   1. Click the plus icon in the Toolset panel  
   2. Create a manual blob tool, setting the tag to “cell” and choosing whatever layer you want, like “brightfield”.  
   3. Click “Create tool”  
   4. Click on the tool and circle a few cells.  
3. Identify spots. Let’s say you have a number of spots in the Cy3 layer.  
   1. Create a Piscis (Predict) tool. Be sure to set the Layer to Cy3 and the tag to “RNA”  
   2. Click the tool to open the tool panel.  
   3. You can use the defaults. Just click “Compute”. It should find spots for you.  
   4. If you want, you can change the model and see what happens. Press command-z to undo the spots you just added. Now click the tool to open the panel again, and change the model to ps\_20240419\_112256 (more permissive model). Click “Compute” again.  
4. Count spots per cell.  
   1. Open the Measure Objects tab (top menu bar).  
   2. Under “Create Measurements for Objects Matching”, click in the tag region. Select “cell”.  
   3. This will automatically fill in blob for the shape.  
   4. Now click on algorithm to select an algorithm. Click “Point count”. It will bring up some options. Set “Tags of points to count” to “RNA”.  
   5. Click “Submit”. That will make your worker.  
   6. Click the play button next to your new worker.  
   7. Go to the “Object list” tab in the top menu bar.  
   8. Click on the Properties dropdown and click the checkbox for the name of your property.  
   9. The counts should show up in the list next to your annotations. Your list might have a lot of RNA objects. If you want to just show the cell objects, use the tag picker at the top of the object list to deselect RNA.  
5. When you are done, you can count cells by going into Object list \-\> Actions \-\> Export CSV. Then you can analyze the result in Excel.

## 3D point counting

Sometimes you have 3D z-stack data in which you want to count spots. A common concern in spot counting is that you don’t want to under count spots that are on top of each other, and you don’t want to double count spots that show up in multiple z-planes. The procedure here is similar to that of the Counting RNA spots example, but with a couple minor differences:

1. Circle cells. Let’s first do this manually.  
   1. Click the plus icon in the Toolset panel  
   2. Create a manual blob tool, setting the tag to “cell” and choosing whatever layer you want, like “brightfield”.  
   3. Click “Create tool”  
   4. Click on the tool and circle a few cells.  
2. Identify spots. Let’s say you have a number of spots in the Cy3 layer.  
   1. Create a Piscis (Predict) tool. Be sure to set the Layer to Cy3 and the tag to “RNA”  
   2. Click the tool to open the tool panel.  
   3. Change the “Mode” to “z-stack”  
   4. Now click “Compute”. It should find spots for you.  
   5. If you want, you can change the model and see what happens. Press command-z to undo the spots you just added. Now click the tool to open the panel again, and change the model to ps\_20240419\_112256 (more permissive model). Click “Compute” again.  
3. Count spots per cell.  
   1. Open the Measure Objects tab (top menu bar).  
   2. Under “Create Measurements for Objects Matching”, click in the tag region. Select “cell”.  
   3. This will automatically fill in blob for the shape.  
   4. Now click on algorithm to select an algorithm. Click “Point count”. It will bring up some options. Set “Count points across all z-slices” to “True” and set “Tags of points to count” to “RNA”.  
   5. Click “Submit”. That will make your worker.  
   6. Click the play button next to your new worker.  
   7. Go to the “Object list” tab in the top menu bar.  
   8. Click on the Properties dropdown and click the checkbox for the name of your property.  
   9. The counts should show up in the list next to your annotations. Your list might have a lot of RNA objects. If you want to just show the cell objects, use the tag picker at the top of the object list to deselect RNA.  
4. When you are done, you can count cells by going into Object list \-\> Actions \-\> Export CSV. Then you can analyze the result in Excel.

## Point assignment to nuclei

Let’s say you have a bunch of spots that you want to assign to the nearest nuclei without explicitly demarcating the cell boundaries. In this case, you can connect points to the nearest object and then count the number of connected points.

1. Circle nuclei. Let’s first do this manually for this example, but you could also use an automated worker.  
   1. Click the plus icon in the Toolset panel  
   2. Create a manual blob tool, setting the tag to “nucleus” and choosing whatever layer you want, like “DAPI”.  
   3. Click “Create tool”  
   4. Click on the tool and circle a few cells.  
2. Identify spots. Let’s say you have a number of spots in the Cy3 layer.  
   1. Create a Piscis (Predict) tool. Be sure to set the Layer to Cy3 and the tag to “RNA”  
   2. Click the tool to open the tool panel.  
   3. Change the “Mode” to “z-stack”  
   4. Now click “Compute”. It should find spots for you.  
   5. If you want, you can change the model and see what happens. Press command-z to undo the spots you just added. Now click the tool to open the panel again, and change the model to ps\_20240419\_112256 (more permissive model). Click “Compute” again.  
   6. You should now have a lot of points, many of which are well outside of the nucleus.  
3. Connect spots to nuclei  
   1. To do this, use the “Connect to nearest” tool.  
      1. Change the name to “Connect points to nearest”  
      2. Click Add tool to toolset  
      3. Click the “Connect points to nearest” tool.  
      4. Set the parent tag to be “Nucleus” and child tag to be “RNA”.  
      5. If you want to connect across Z, set Connect across Z to Yes.  
      6. Change the radius (search radius) if so desired. That’s the maximum radius it will use to look for RNA to connect to a nucleus.  
      7. Click “Compute”  
   2. You should see connections.  
4. Count spots connected to each nucleus.  
   1. Open the Measure Objects tab (top menu bar).  
   2. Under “Create Measurements for Objects Matching”, click in the tag region. Select “Nucleus”.  
   3. This will automatically fill in blob for the shape.  
   4. Now click on algorithm to select an algorithm. Click “Count children”. It will bring up some options. Set “Child tags” to “RNA”.  
   5. Click “Submit”. That will make your worker.  
   6. Click the play button next to your new worker.  
   7. Go to the “Object list” tab in the top menu bar.  
   8. Click on the Properties dropdown and click the checkbox for the name of your property.  
   9. The counts should show up in the list next to your annotations. Your list might have a lot of RNA objects. If you want to just show the cell objects, use the tag picker at the top of the object list to deselect RNA.  
5. When you are done, you can count cells by going into Object list \-\> Actions \-\> Export CSV. Then you can analyze the result in Excel.

## Time lapse analysis

Let’s say that you want to track a cell’s fluorescence over time in a time lapse video. There are several ways to do this and visualize the results in NimbusImage. Once you get your data into NimbusImage, here are the steps:

1. Import your data. Make sure your time points are loaded into the time variable.  
2. Find cells. You can do this manually, or do it using an automated worker like cellpose (see above). Set the tag to “nucleus”. The only difference is that here, you will want to batch over all your time points. So set Batch time to your full range, like 1-100.  
3. A key step with time lapse analysis is the visualization of the results. NimbusImage is very flexible in this regard. One very helpful trick is to show the next time point:  
   1. In the left panel under Layers, you will find a plus sign. Click the plus. This will create a new layer.   
   2. You can rename the layer as “GFP next” or whatever you like. You can set the color also.  
   3. The key point is to set the channel to the same channel as before, in this case, “GFP”.  
   4. Click “Advanced layer options”  
   5. Under Time-Slice, select Offset and change the value to 1\. This will make it so the layer shows the next time point.  
   6. You should now see the current time and the next time point at once.  
4. Now you will want to connect the cells to each other over time. To do this, use the “Connect sequential” tool.  
   1. Change the name to “Connect points”  
   2. Click Add tool to toolset  
   3. Click the “Connect points” tool.  
   4. Change the radius (search radius) if so desired.  
   5. Click “Compute”  
5. You should now see lines that connect across time.  
6. To compute fluorescence intensity and track over time:  
   1. Open the Measure Objects tab (top menu bar).  
   2. Under “Create Measurements for Objects Matching”, click in the tag region. Select “nucleus”.  
   3. This will automatically fill in blob for the shape.  
   4. Now click on algorithm to select an algorithm. Click “Blob intensity”. It will bring up some options. Set “Channel” to “GFP”.  
   5. Click “Submit”. That will make your worker.  
   6. Click the play button next to your new worker.  
   7. Go to the “Object list” tab in the top menu bar.  
   8. Click on the Properties dropdown and click the name of your property.  
   9. That should reveal several subproperties, including mean intensity. Click the checkbox and you will see the values in the list.  
   10. Go back to Measure objects tab.  
   11. Follow the same procedure, but this time select “Parent and Child” under algorithm.  
   12. Click the play button and you will get a set of ID variables that will represent your time lapse data.  
7. You may want to edit your connections to fix errors. To delete connections, you can make a new tool using the “Lasso Disconnect” (default values). You can just draw a circle around a false connection to remove it. If you want to make a new connection, make a “Click connect” tool. Then you can just click the parent and then the child to make a new connection. We recommend assigning these to hotkeys to enable rapid editing.  
8. When you are done, you can count cells by going into Object list \-\> Actions \-\> Export CSV. Then you can analyze the result in Excel. You can use the parent and child identifiers to perform temporal analyses.

# Snapshots

Snapshots are a way to document individual images within your dataset. We have found that it is often hard to relocate the original source of the “representative image” that is in your paper, grant, or presentation. Snapshots are like a bookmark in your dataset that can bring you back to the specific region of the image with your contrast settings saved so you know exactly where the image came from. You can also download the images to paste directly into your document preparation application.

1. To generate a snapshot:  
   1. Navigate to the location of the image and adjust the contrast as desired.  
   2. Click on the “Snapshots” tab in the top menu bar.  
   3. A red square outline will show up (sometimes you have to zoom out to see it).  
   4. Adjust the square to be the size you want. You can also type in coordinates and sizes in case you want to specify a precise size.  
      1. "SET FRAME TO CURRENT VIEW"   
         1. If you've zoomed into a place you like, click this button and the frame of the Snapshot will be set to precisely the region you zoomed to.  
      2. "SET FRAME TO MAXIMUM VIEW SIZE"   
         1. This button will reset the frame to contain the entire image in the view.  
   5. Click "SAVE AS SNAPSHOT..." button.  
   6. In the "Create New Snapshot" dialog:  
      1. Enter a "Snapshot name" (required).  
      2. Add "Tags" if desired for organization.  
      3. Provide a "Snapshot description" if needed.  
      4. Click "CREATE SNAPSHOT" to save.  
   7. Your snapshot should appear in the snapshot list. You can click the Snapshot to take you directly to that part of your data.  
   8. To download a snapshot  
      1. Under "Download Snapshot Images", choose between:  
         1. Select the desired layers and scaling options:  
            1. **Scaled layers vs Raw channels**: You can either download contrasted images or raw pixel value images. Note that all contrasts are linear and hence allowed by most major journals.  
            2. **Layer download options**: There are several ways you can download your images:  
               1. *All layers*: Gives you an image file for each layer separately.  
               2. *Composite layers*: Gives you a composite image with all layers merged together, matching what is on screen.  
               3. *Individual layers*: Allows you to download an image just for the specific layer selected.  
         2. Select the file type.  
         3. Download the files  
            1. "DOWNLOAD IMAGES FOR CURRENT LOCATION": Downloads the current view.  
            2. "DOWNLOAD IMAGES FOR ALL SNAPSHOTS": Batch download all saved snapshots.  
            3. "DOWNLOAD SCREENSHOT OF CURRENT VIEWPORT": Allows you to download a "screenshot", which includes all annotations and the scale bar.  
            4. Additional notes:  
               1. As the software stands, DOWNLOAD IMAGES FOR CURRENT LOCATION and DOWNLOAD IMAGES FOR ALL SNAPSHOTS do not include the scale bar. 

# Common questions:

1. How do I export my results from NimbusImage?  
   1. The main two things you may want to export from NimbusImage are your properties (i.e., measurements) and the full specification of the objects themselves.  
   2. The properties can be exported from the Object list \-\> Actions \-\> Export CSV. That will give you a table with all the object identifiers and the values of all the properties, like area, intensity, spot count, and so on. You can then use that in Excel or various statistical packages to make graphs and perform analyses.  
   3. All annotations, connections, and properties can be downloaded from Object list \-\> Actions \-\> Export to JSON. This option will export the full coordinate-level information about every object, connection, and property in the entire dataset. This is useful for sophisticated downstream analyses and also for fully documenting your analysis. This can also be reimported using Object list \-\> Actions \-\> Import from JSON.  
2. What statistical analyses can I perform within NimbusImage?  
   1. NimbusImage won’t perform statistical analyses of comparisons between samples. What NimbusImage can do is get you the numbers that you can then use to make graphs and perform comparisons in whatever analyses program you chose, be it R, Excel, or something else.  
3. How can I compare multiple datasets?  
   1. If you have multiple datasets, it can be useful to put them together into a collection. That way, you have a common set of tools and visualizations to look at all your datasets with.  
4. What options are available for 3D image analysis?  
   1. NimbusImage is “2.5” dimensional. It certainly can read 3D data, and many segmentation programs can run across the whole stack. However, it does not yet have the capability to truly consider an object three dimensional. We are working on it\!  
   2. Importantly, spot counting with Piscis can be performed in 3D, meaning that each spot is assigned to just one particular Z slice. To do that, select the “Z-stack” option in Piscis Predict.  
5. How can I collaborate with other researchers using NimbusImage?  
   1. Just send them a link to your data\!  
6. How can I prevent artifacts detected as object from making it into my data?  
   1. In most programs, you would go back and tweak settings to try and remove those artifacts. However, our experience is that it is very difficult to get these settings perfectly right, and there are always artifacts. NimbusImage shines here because it allows you to interact with your data and fix these various issues directly. Just select objects you don’t want, either by shift-drag or shift click or selecting them in the Object list \-\> Annotation List and then either click “Delete Selected” in the Annotation List bar or just hit command-delete. If you need to add some that were missed, make a manual annotation tool (with the same tag) and it will seamlessly be included in your downstream analyses.  
7. How can I select and delete particular objects that I don’t want?  
   1. Couple ways. You can shift and drag a region. That will select them all. Then do command/control delete, and that will delete them.  
   2. You can also select them in the Object list and then either do command/control delete or click “delete selected” button at the top of the Object list.  
8. Can I import settings or workflows from other analysis tools?  
   1. This is unfortunately not an option at this time, given that NimbusImage works quite differently than most other packages. However, if there is a particular analysis algorithm you want to have implemented, please let us know\!

# Advanced Features:

1. How can I create custom analysis workflows in NimbusImage?  
   1. NimbusImage is flexible enough to allow most workflows—it is inherently designed to allow for you to design the interface and structure that works best for you.  
2. What machine learning capabilities does NimbusImage offer?  
   1. NimbusImage makes it easy to use a number of popular machine learning tools, like cellpose and stardist for cell segmentation and Piscis for spot detection. It also allows you to use the Segment Anything Model to click on your image and segment objects easily.  
3. How can I integrate external tools or scripts with NimbusImage?  
   1. NimbusImage can be interacted with via a Python notebook, which can directly connect to the backend server (Girder). Another, perhaps simpler, way to integrate outside tools is the ability to import and export JSON files (Object List \-\> Actions \-\> Import from JSON/Export to JSON). The easiest way to get started is to download a JSON from a dataset you have annotated, then feed that JSON into an LLM, which can help you write code to convert your analyzed data into a JSON that you can import into NimbusImage.  
4. What options are available for automating repetitive tasks?  
   1. Machine learning tools like cellpose, stardist, Piscis, and Segment Anything Model provide a way to automate many image analysis tasks. Some of these workers are also applicable in “batch mode”, meaning that they can be applied to your entire dataset if so desired.  
5. What are the best practices for analyzing large-scale datasets?  
   1. We strongly recommend starting with a small version of your dataset and trying the analysis on that smaller dataset first. That will allow you to fine-tune your parameters and workflow. Then you can scale up to larger groups of images. In principle, NimbusImage can handle very large datasets, up to many tens or even hundreds of gigabytes per file. However, these very large datasets do trigger some extensive preprocessing up front to work well, so we recommend waiting until those preprocessing tasks finish before interacting with your data.

# Troubleshooting:

1. What should I do if NimbusImage is running slowly?  
   1. A simple first step is to refresh the page, which can often resolve issues that crop up periodically.  
   2. Another time when NimbusImage can appear slow is in the initial loading of the data. NimbusImage performs a number of background optimizations while you are first looking at your data. For larger datasets, this can take a little time, and performance can be slower while these optimizations are happening.  
   3. NimbusImage can also slow down when it has to download, render, and manipulate very large numbers of annotations, numbering in the hundreds of thousands and especially into many millions. We suggesting filtering the annotations down to a more manageable number to display. Also, we are working on optimizations that will allow for these use cases, so hopefully it will not be an issue for much longer.  
2. How can I recover unsaved work if the application crashes?  
   1. There is no notion of “Saving” your work in NimbusImage. NimbusImage sends any annotations you draw back to the server. As soon as it is committed to the server, it is saved, like in Google Docs. However, there are times when the back-end server might crash or desynchronize from your browser, in which case you could lose your work. At the top right of the screen is a little floppy disk icon. If that is red and showing an error, that indicates an issue communicating with the server, and you should refresh the page before continuing work. If the issue persists, contact support.  
3. My segmentation results seem inaccurate. How can I fix them?  
   1. Most machine learning tools have two relevant aspects: one is the underlying statistical model itself, and the other is input parameters. If your input parameters are   
4. What should I do if I encounter an error message?  
   1. The first thing to do is to refresh the page and try again. If that doesn’t work, then note down the error and contact support.  
5. How can I report a bug or request a new feature?  
   1. Contact us\!  
6. How do I troubleshoot issues with importing data?  
   1. Check the documentation on importing data. NimbusImage supports most files. Contact support if you are still having trouble.
