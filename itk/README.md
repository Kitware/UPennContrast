## ITK environment setup

Debuging directly from the wasm files generated by `npm run build-workers-*****` is hard.
You can do a native build using CMake and the build system of your choice.
If you do so, you will need to:
- Download ITK (tested with ITK 5.2.1)
- Build it. Debug should be the default build type
- Specify the path to ITK to CMake using CMake GUI or using the CLI argument: `-DITK_DIR=/path/to/ITK/build`

### Using Visual Studio

If you don't want to pollute your project folder with many VS files:
- Open this folder (`UPenn/itk`) in VS: Open VS -> Open a local folder
- Specify ITK_DIR (build directory of ITK) to CMake: Right click CMakeLists.txt -> CMake Settings for ...
- To give cli arguments to your startup items: Debug -> Debug and launch settings for ... -> Add a line `"args": ["foo", "bar"]`
