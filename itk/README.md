## ITK environment setup

Debuging directly from the wasm files generated by `npm run build-workers` is hard.
You can build files using CMake and the build system of your choice.
If you do so, you will need to download ITK (tested with ITK 5.2.1), build it (beware the build type) and specify the path to ITK to CMake.

### Using Visual Studio

If you don't want to pollute your project folder with many VS files:
- Open this folder (`UPenn/itk`) in VS: Open VS -> Open a local folder
- Specify ITK_DIR (build directory of ITK) to CMake: Right click CMakeLists.txt -> CMake Settings for ...
- To give cli arguments to your startup items: Debug -> Debug and launch settings for ... -> Add a line `"args": ["foo", "bar"]`
